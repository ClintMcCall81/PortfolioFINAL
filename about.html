                    Hi! My name is Clint McCall, Im a avid gamer and inspiring UI Designer. I currently live in
                    Toronto where I currently study Interaction Design at George Brown College. I have a long history
                    with design (since highschool) back when I took Cyber Arts at Northview Heights Secondary School and 
                    have always wanted to pursue my dream of becoming a Game Designer / Level Designer at Ubisoft Toronto
                    however due to difficulties I had to switch studys to my current field of study. This however hasnt swayed
                    me from pursuing my dream of game design in general. Im still learning and trying my hardest to build a portfolio
                    worthy of getting me into the game design industry.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subheading-h4">My Inspiration</h4>
                <p class="description">
                    As previously mentioned I am a avid gamer. I play lots of games on my spare time, mostly to take breaks 
                    between assignments, but also to gain insperation from other developers on how they desinged there games
                    unique user interfaces all the way down from the HUDS, GUIS, etc... Its tons of fun to see how they fit 
                    information of the player into well made graphical elements. Being able to think as the player is something
                    ive been trying to hone my skills for when it comes to game design, and to be completely honest I think of
                    Interaction Design the same way I think of games and there interfaces. Its what keeps me learning about the
                    theory and thought behind the elements on the screen!
                </p>
